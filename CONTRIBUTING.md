### Authorship Principles

- White paper authorship is based on substantial intellectual contribution
- Authorship is not automatic and is evaluated at the end of the sprint
- Future academic papers will determine authorship independently
- Final authorship decisions are made by the project lead, following academic norms

Authorship and recognition are based on **impact, ownership, and quality of contribution**.
Volume of output alone — including lines of code, commits, or automatically generated artifacts —
does not determine recognition.

### Public Recognition

Meaningful contributions may be acknowledged in public project communications.
Recognition is based on delivered impact, quality of contribution, and demonstrated reasoning,
not intent or exploratory activity alone.
