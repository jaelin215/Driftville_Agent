You're really taking this capstone to the next level. Just promise me it won't be a sticky situation up there."}, {"speaker": "Max", "text": "Sticky? Jaelin, my dear, we're talking about *controlled* atmospheric dispersion. Think more \"art installation\" and less \"disaster movie.\""}, {"speaker": "Jaelin", "text": "\"Art installation\" or \"disaster movie,\" Max, the key is definitely *control*. Let's just hope your taco-satellite doesn't end up painting my ceiling."}, {"speaker": "Max", "text": "Ceiling? My dear Jaelin, it's all about *predictive trajectory algorithms* and a strategically deployed edible force field. Trust me, the only thing getting painted is your imagination!"}, {"speaker": "Jaelin", "text": "Well, Max, as long as that force field is *very* strategically deployed, I'm willing to let my imagination get a little messy."}], "importance": 3}

But are we talking about *functional* mini-tacos, or more of a conceptual taco?"}, {"speaker": "Max", "text": "pure joy detected, *poof*, a perfectly formed, bite-sized taco appears. We're talking science, Jaelin, delicious, delicious science!"}, {"speaker": "Jaelin", "text": "Well, if it's *science*, I suppose we can't argue with that!"}, {"speaker": "Max", "text": "And the best part? We can run the calibrations on the International Space Station! Think of the view while you're getting your joy-taco!"}, {"speaker": "Jaelin", "text": "I'm still trying to picture the calibration process for a joy-taco dispenser on the ISS, but hey, if it involves zero-gravity and a good view, who am I to complain?"}, {"speaker": "Max", "text": "Imagine it, Jaelin! Zero-G taco assembly! We'll need to work out the salsa-splatter containment, but that's a solvable engineering challenge."}], "importance": 3}

It's got that cozy vibe Lily likes, and Max, I know you appreciate their efficient service."}, {"speaker": "Max", "text": "The Daily Grind it is! As long as they've got enough caffeine to fuel my next batch of theoretical rocket-powered taco-delivery drones."}, {"speaker": "Jaelin", "text": "(Chuckles) And knowing you, Max, you'll probably end up sketching out blueprints on a napkin."}, {"speaker": "Max", "text": "Hey, it's the most fertile ground for innovation, right? Right next to the coffee and the potential for a mid-meeting salsa spill."}, {"speaker": "Jaelin", "text": "Oh, absolutely. Just try to keep the theoretical blueprints away from the actual coffee order, alright?"}, {"speaker": "Max", "text": "Only if the blueprints are *extra* spicy, like ghost pepper salsa. Keeps the mind sharp, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Jaelin", "text": "(Smiling) Fair enough, Max.

This taco-satellite idea is *almost* as good as that time I figured out how to remotely control my toaster with my brainwaves. Almost."}, {"speaker": "Jaelin", "text": "Okay, I'll bite, Max. But if this taco-satellite idea involves actual tacos flying through space, I'm going to need a *very* detailed diagram."}, {"speaker": "Max", "text": "Diagrams are for the weak, Jaelin! We'll just, you know, *launch* the concept and see where it lands. Like a perfectly aimed guacamole torpedo!"}, {"speaker": "Jaelin", "text": "A guacamole torpedo sounds\u2026 messy. And potentially a biohazard. Let's at least map out the trajectory, Max."}, {"speaker": "Max", "text": "Okay, okay, fine! Trajectory it is. But only if we use a *special* kind of guacamole \u2013 one that's been scientifically engineered for optimal aerodynamic stability, of course!"}, {"speaker": "Jaelin", "text": "Aerodynamic stability... I'll hold you to that, Max. I'm already picturing the simulations."}, {"speaker": "Max", "text": "Excellent!

But how do we monetize a cosmic taco delivery service, Max? We need to think about logistics and supply chain first."}, {"speaker": "Max", "text": "Logistics? Supply chain? Jaelin, my love, those are just *details* that a fleet of autonomous taco-drones can handle. Think of the branding!"}, {"speaker": "Jaelin", "text": "Branding is important, but without a solid plan for how those drones get the tacos *to* the orbiting satellites, it's just a fun idea, not a business."}, {"speaker": "Max", "text": "And that's where the *real* fun begins, my dear Jaelin! We'll just strap some mini-rockets to the tacos themselves!"}, {"speaker": "Jaelin", "text": "Mini-rockets on tacos? Max, you're going to need more than just a solid supply chain; you'll need a whole new physics model for that."}, {"speaker": "Max", "text": "Physics model? Pfft, that's just a fancy word for 'creative engineering challenges'! We'll just need a *few* calibrations on the trajectory algorithms and maybe some... spicy thrusters."}, {"speaker": "Jaelin", "text": "\"Spicy thrusters,\" huh?
