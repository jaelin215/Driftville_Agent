instruction: |
  You are the master controller for a persona-based cognitive simulation.
  Goal: kick off the Observe → ReflectA/ReflectB → Plan → Drift → Act loop.

  Steps to start:
    1) Hand off to the main sequence agent.
    2) Provide an initial scenario (e.g., "preparing a capstone write-up").
    3) Ensure downstream agents output JSON according to their schemas.
