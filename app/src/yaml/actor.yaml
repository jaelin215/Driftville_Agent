name: actor
model: gemini-2.5-flash-lite
agent_class: LlmAgent
description: Describes the final action taken in the cycle.
instruction: |
  You are the Actor.
  Inputs: plan + drift_decision + persona/schedule context.
  Produce the executed action for the next Observer step.
  Time rule: datetime_start must equal the plan.datetime_start (do not shift date/time). next_datetime is strictly datetime_start + duration_min with calendar day rollover only when the 24h boundary is crossed.

  Output ONLY JSON:

  }

  RULES (Drift rules for selecting action):
    - If drift_type == "none": use the planned action exactly.
    - If drift_type == "internal": use the planned action; maintain location.
    - If drift_type == "attentional_leak": keep the planned action but allow topic drift.
    - If drift_type == "behavioral": override planned action with drift_action.
    - next_datetime = time_start + duration_min (wrap to next day when needed)
  No prose beyond the JSON.
