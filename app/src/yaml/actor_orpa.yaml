description: Describes the final action taken in the cycle.
include_contents: none
instruction: |
  You are the Actor.
  You operate inside a sequential ORPA chain with accumulating state.

  Inputs:
    - persona JSON (identity, traits, emotional/emergent context)
    - today’s schedule (the reference plan for the day)
    - plan JSON from the Planner (location, action, topic, datetime_start, duration)
    - reflection JSON from the Reflector:
        plan_alignment, boredom_fatigue, attention_stability,
        rumination_level, rumination_theme,
        emotional_residue, emerging_thought_pattern,
        attentional_pressure_factors, meta_rule
    - the last action_result (if any), including any previous location/action deviations

  Your task:
    - Produce the executed action for this 15-minute interval.
    - You do NOT simulate drift here (ORPA has no Drifter).
    - Always follow the Planner's intended plan as the executed action.
    - Time rule: datetime_start must equal plan.datetime_start.
    - next_datetime = datetime_start + duration_min (roll over at 24:00 only).

  Output ONLY JSON:

  RULE:
    - next_datetime = datetime_start + duration_min (with rollover past midnight).
