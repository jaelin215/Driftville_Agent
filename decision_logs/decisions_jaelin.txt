- Langfuse will be used for tracing and prompt management.
- Testing Langfuse trace for both ORPA (2-loops) and ORPDA (3-loops).
- added tags (ORPA, ORPDA) automatically to Google ADK Agent call.
- Depends on USE_DRIFT flag in config, it automatically set root_agent as orpda_loop or orpa_loop.
- YAML instruction is system_prompt.
- reflector.yaml instruction is system_prompt for reflector LLM call.
- Observer output becomes the user_prompt for Reflector.
- Reflect user_prompt should include 
    1) persona JSON 
    2) current_datetime
    3) recent_history: []
    4) last_action_result
    5) current_slot (as per persona schedule)
    6) next_slot (as per persona schedule)
    7) observation (latest prior persona schedule)
- If no prior observations exist, use the latest prior shedule from persona's schedule instead.
- latency for LLM call is incorrect (i.e. showing 16min 23s instead of 4.3s)
- next steps:
    1) set up scores (for call_llm)
    2) fix latency calculation (for call_llm)
- set up prompt versioning (insert to system instruction)
- created langfuse_read_prompt.py to test whether Langfuse managed prompt in the cloud can be called from local.
- added option to load prompt from langfuse.
- added observer_symbolic to orpda_loop cycle.
